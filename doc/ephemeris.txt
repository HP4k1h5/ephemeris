ephemeris.txt* Diary utility for vim

Author:  bob <robertwalks@gmail.com>

INTRODUCTION                                    *ephemeris*

This script creates a configurable markdown diary index window in vim based on
the directories and files found recursively under the directory set in the
global variable `g:calendar_diary` , which is the same variable as that used
by [calendar-vim](https:///github.com/mattn/calendar-vim). It does not rely on
any external programs and does not interfere with any external program, such
as cal, etc.
Nevertheless, the diary functionality provided by calendar-vim is not
reduplicated by this plugin. this plugin works best when the directory
structure of `g:calendar_diary` is as follows:
```
├── 2019
│   └── 11
│       ├── 09.md
│       └── 20.md
├── 2020
│   └── 05
│       ├── 01.md
│       ├── 04.md
```
This tree structure is provided by default by the calendar-vim diary functions.
`ephemeris` will only provide limited functionality if the directory structure
does not include a date-aligned directory structure as outlined above.
**Therefore it is recommended to use this plugin together with calendar-vim.**


COMMANDS                               *ephemeris-commands*

                                ```
                                ### TODOs
                                - [ ] ephemeris docs
                                  -[x] `.md`
                                  -[ ] `txt`
                                - [x] export autocommands
                                ``` 
                                in the `g:calendar_diary` directory. and
                                copies those to the current day's diary entry.
                                if you wish to use a different `TODO` prefix,
                                  other than the default `TODOs`
                                `:set g:ephemeris_todos = "=== TASK LIST ==="`
                                Everything below that marker is copied and
                                append into the current day's diary entry.
                                ex: |:EphemerisCopyTodos|
                                
                                       *ephemeris-:EphemerisFilterTasks*
:EphemerisFilterTasks           Create and show diary index in a vertical 
                                split. i.e. if you have a set of tasks like:
                                ```
                                - [ ] ephemeris docs
                                  -[x] `.md`
                                    - more list items but not tasks
                                      and a nested block of text
                                      with a few lines
                                  -[ ] `txt`
                                - [x] export autocommands
                                ``` 
                                and you run `:EphemerisFilterTasks` in the
                                command-line mode, you will be left with
                                ```
                                - [ ] ephemeris docs
                                  -[ ] `txt`
                                ```
