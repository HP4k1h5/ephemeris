INTRODUCTION                                                 *ephemeris-intro*

ephemeris is a diary and calendar extension plugin for vim. It provides a
collection of functions and commands that can be used to create, edit and,
curate diary/log entries.

the directories and files found recursively under the directory set in the
global variable `g:calendar_diary` , which is the same variable as that used
by [calendar-vim](https:///github.com/mattn/calendar-vim). It does not rely on
any external programs and does not interfere with any external program, such
as cal, etc.  Nevertheless, the diary functionality provided by calendar-vim
is not reduplicated by this plugin. this plugin works best when the directory
structure of `g:calendar_diary` is as follows:
>
  ├── 2019
  │   └── 11
  │       ├── 09.md
  │       └── 20.md
  ├── 2020
  │   └── 05
  │       ├── 01.md
  │       ├── 04.md
<
This tree structure is provided by default by the calendar-vim diary
functions. @plugin(name( will only provide limited functionality if the
directory structure does not include a date-aligned directory structure as
outlined above. **Therefore it is recommended to use this plugin together with
calendar-vim.**

FUNCTIONS                                                *ephemeris-functions*

ephemeris#ind#goto_index()                        *ephemeris#ind#goto_index()*
  Find or create, and go to diary index file. Index located at
  |g:calendar_diary|/index.md.

ephemeris#ind#create_index()                    *ephemeris#ind#create_index()*
  Create an index of diary entries found recursively under the
  |g:calendar_diary| directory at |g:calendar_diary|/index.md, and open the
  index in a vertical split. Entries are formatted as markdown links.

ephemeris#lst#copy_todos()                        *ephemeris#lst#copy_todos()*
  Copy TODOs from last set of TODOs going back up to 10 years. Your
  |g:calendar_diary| directory must  be organized in a `.../YYYY/MM/DD.md`
  hierarchy, in order for this function to know which set of TODOs are _most
  recent_. TODOs are defined by the string set in |g:ephemeris_todos|. Default
  is 'TODOs'. **Everything** below that marker is copied to the current day's
  diary entry. It will open today's diary entry in a split. This function can
  be called from anywhere.

ephemeris#lst#filter_tasks()                    *ephemeris#lst#filter_tasks()*
  Filter out completed tasks and their associated blocks in the current
  buffer. e.g.
