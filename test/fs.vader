~ Test fs.vim 

" fs.vim contains a collection of wrapper functions for filesystem and variable get/set operations. Most of these functions throw errors that should be handled and tested in the parent scope.

" g:ephemeris_diary should not exist, therefore
Execute (get_g_diary and expect it to throw):
  AssertThrows call ephemeris#fs#get_g_diary()
  AssertEqual g:vader_exception, 'required global variable `g:ephemeris_diary` has not been set' . '... set with `:let g:ephemeris_diary="~/diary"`'
