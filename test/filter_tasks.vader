~ Test filter tasks

" lst#filter_tasks() should delete completed tasks from the buffer.
" a completed task is defined as one that starts with the string `-
" [x]`.  lst#filter_tasks() removes lines including a line beginning
" with the completed task marker, up to the end of the file or an
" incomplete task. this means, currently if you have a completed
" task, followed by anything other than a `g:ephemeris_todos` marker
" OR 2 newlines, everything following the function until EOF will be
" filtered OUT, i.e. deleted.

==========================================
# test 1
Given (three lines of tasks):
  - [x] complete task A, should be removed
  - [ ] incomplete task B
  - [x] complete task C

Execute (filter_tasks):
  : call ephemeris#lst#filter_tasks()

Expect(Check that the incomplete task has been removed):
  - [ ] incomplete task B


==========================================
# test 2
" filtering should stop on 2 newlines, newlines should be preserved
Given (tasks and 2 newlines and list items ensuing):
  - [x] complete task A, should be removed


  - a list item
Execute (filter_tasks):
  : call ephemeris#lst#filter_tasks()

Expect(2 newlines to halt task filtering, and the list item to remain):
  

  - a list item


==========================================
# test 3
Given (tasks and the default g:ephemeris_todos marker string):
  - [x] complete task A, should be removed
  TODOs
  - a list item
Execute (filter_tasks):
  : call ephemeris#lst#filter_tasks()

Expect(the completed task to be removed and the ensuing list item to be preserved):
  TODOs
  - a list item
